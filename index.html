        <strong>about</strong>

        <p>
            I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a> based at Stockholm University, 
            and part of the Formas funded <a href="https://www.waterresilience.earth">SAFER project</a> Safeguarding Freshwater Resilience in 
            the Anthropocene. The project aims to understand how severe and widespread anthropogenic changes to the global freshwater cycle impacts distant regions and countries through 
            teleconnections, both bio-physical [e.g. the atmospheric moisture transport of evaporated water from one place to fall as precipitation in another], and socio-economic [e.g. the 'virtual' water that is emodied in the 
            commodities we trade and consume].

        <strong>reseach focus</strong>

        <p>
            The hydrological cycle plays an important role in regulating the functioning and stability of the Earth system, sustaining biodiversity and 
            capturing carbon, and is deeply tied to human livelihoods. All the while, the global hydrological cycle is characterised by intricate and 
            interdependent coupled systems and feedbacks. Human-induced changes to the biosphere, such as deforestation, intensive agriculture, ever-increasing CO2 
            emissions, and extensive irrigation, are altering patterns of <u>rainfall</u>, <u>soil moisture</u>, and <u>transpiration from plants</u>, globally. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My research is focussed on understanding global scale freshwater resilience. By Looking at changes to these three freshwater variables, I aim to identify which regions in the world are showing signs of water
            resilience loss, and better to understand the role of hydrological teleconnections in propagating the effects of water resilience loss to distant regions.

        <p>
           Using data from satellite remote sensing, my methods include statistical analysis, emperical dynamic modelling, and network analysis.
